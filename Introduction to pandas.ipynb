    "### Using Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to write and run Python code on your computer. One way -- the method we're using today -- is to use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which run in your browser and allow you to intersperse documentation with your code. They're handy for bundling your code with a human-readable explanation of what's happening at each step. Check out some examples from the [L.A. Times](https://github.com/datadesk/notebooks) and [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything#data-and-analyses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**To add a new cell to your notebook**: Click the + button in the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run a cell of code**: Select the cell and click the \"Run\" button in the menu, or you can press Shift+Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One common gotcha**: The notebook doesn't \"know\" about code you've written until you've _run_ the cell containing it. For example, if you define a variable called `my_name` in one cell, and later, when you try to access that variable in another cell but get an error that says `NameError: name 'my_name' is not defined`, the most likely solution is to run (or re-run) the cell in which you defined `my_name`."
